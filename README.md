The code I was working on was long and full of non-semantic elements, which looked kind of boring for the programmers. As a starting coder, I did my best to change as many non-semantic elements as I could to semantic elements that could describe the content of the code.

-Title:
The title was very vague and misunderstadabel. It looks much better now. It's specific and concise.

-Main: 
The main code (content) was full of repeated uncombined and unnecessary codes and tags. Now they are combined, and the tags are less and breif doing the same goal. Many semantic elements are added, and now they describe the content of the file. The semantic elements follow a logical structure. Each image now has accessible alt attributes. Comments are inlcuded to describe most of the important added elements.

-Footer:
I did not touch the footer since it looked great so far.

-CSS file:
CSS file has a long list of uncombined classes and id's. Now they are less and combined so far. They are breif as well. CSS selectors follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
